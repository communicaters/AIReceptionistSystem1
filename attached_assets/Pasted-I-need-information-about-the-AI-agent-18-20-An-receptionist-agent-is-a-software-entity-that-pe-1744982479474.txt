An receptionist agent is a software entity that performs tasks autonomously using receptionist techniques. These agents can perceive their environment through sensors, process the information and make decisions, and act upon the environment using actuators. AI agents are designed to achieve specific goals and can be categorized into different types based on their complexity and functionality: 1. **Reactive Agents**: These are the simplest type of AI agents. They respond to the current environment state without considering history or future consequences. They donâ€™t have memory or learning capabilities. 2. **Model-Based Agents**: These agents maintain an internal model of the world, which they use to handle partially observable environments. They can make decisions based on history and predict future states. 3. **Goal-Based Agents**: These agents take actions to achieve specific goals. They consider future states and outcomes to make decisions that will bring them closer to their goals. 4. **Utility-Based Agents**: These agents go a step further by considering the best possible outcome. They use a utility function to measure the desirability of different states and choose actions that maximize the expected utility. 5. **Learning Agents**: These agents can learn from their experiences and improve their performance over time. They adapt to changes in the environment and refine their strategies based on feedback. AI agents are used in various applications, including: - **Virtual Assistants**: Like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, which help users perform tasks using voice commands. - **Robotics**: For autonomous robots that can navigate and interact with the environment. - **Game AI**: To control non-player characters (NPCs) and create intelligent behaviors in video games. - **Autonomous Vehicles**: To enable self-driving cars to perceive their surroundings and make driving decisions. - **Customer Service**: Chatbots and virtual agents that handle customer inquiries and support tasks. The design of AI agents involves understanding the environment, developing algorithms for decision-making, and implementing learning mechanisms to adapt and improve over time.
