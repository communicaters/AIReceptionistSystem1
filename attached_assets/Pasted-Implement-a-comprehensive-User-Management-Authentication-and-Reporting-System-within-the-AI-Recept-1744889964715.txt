Implement a comprehensive User Management, Authentication, and Reporting System within the AI Receptionist platform. This must include full-featured admin controls, user-level restrictions based on packages, and detailed reporting tools. The system must not disturb any existing data, modules, or application workflows. It must ensure that the app continues to function exactly as before for existing users until new controls are applied.
