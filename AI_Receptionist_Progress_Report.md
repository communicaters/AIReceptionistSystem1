# AI Receptionist Modular System: Progress Report

## Project Overview
The AI Receptionist Modular System is a comprehensive communication automation platform that leverages advanced NLP and machine learning technologies across multiple channels: voice calls, email, live chat, and WhatsApp. This system aims to unify all communications under a single interface with AI-powered responses and integrations.

### Partially Completed Features
- ⚠️ Calendar Integration: Basic setup complete but meeting scheduling not finished
- ⚠️ AI Core: Basic integration is working but training data management needs improvement
- ⚠️ System Dashboard: Basic monitoring is in place but needs enhanced statistics

### Pending Tasks

#### AI Core & Training (Next Priority)
- ❌ Implement comprehensive training data management UI
- ❌ Create custom training data uploading interface
- ❌ Add categorization system for training data
- ❌ Develop fine-tuning process for domain-specific responses
- ❌ Implement intent detection and mapping system
- ❌ Create vector embeddings for semantic search
- ❌ Add conversation history context management
- ❌ Implement prompt templates with variable substitution

#### Google Calendar Integration
- ❌ Complete OAuth flow for calendar access
- ❌ Add popup window for account selection with auto-close
- ❌ Implement available time slot retrieval based on calendar events
- ❌ Add meeting scheduling functionality across channels
- ❌ Develop secure token storage and encryption

#### Voice Call Enhancements
- ❌ Complete inbound call routing with AI IVR
- ❌ Finalize outbound AI call capabilities with context handling
- ❌ Enhance speech-to-text transcription for calls
- ❌ Implement call sentiment analysis

#### System Dashboard and Analytics
- ❌ Enhance real-time status monitoring for all services
- ❌ Add detailed communication channel statistics
- ❌ Implement comprehensive error logging and reporting
- ❌ Create user behavior analytics dashboard

## Next Steps
The next priority is to implement the **AI Core & Training Module**, which includes:

1. Completing the training data management interface for uploading and categorizing training data
2. Implementing intent detection and mapping for accurate response generation
3. Creating a vector embedding system for semantic search capabilities
4. Developing conversation history management for context-aware responses

Following the AI Core & Training Module, we'll focus on completing the Calendar Integration to enable scheduling across all communication channels.

## Technical Considerations
- All AI training data should be properly categorized and validated
- Intent mapping should support multiple communication channels
- The system should maintain context between conversations
- Vector embeddings should be periodically updated as new training data is added
- All OAuth tokens must be securely stored and encrypted (no plain text)
- Required Google Calendar scopes: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar and https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events
- WebSocket connections must remain stable with proper error handling and reconnection logic

## Current System Status
The system currently has fully functional Voice Call, Email, WhatsApp, and Live Chat modules with proper database integration. All core communication channels are operational with logging and basic AI integration. The next phase will focus on enhancing the AI capabilities through the AI Core & Training Module improvements.
