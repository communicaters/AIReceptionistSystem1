# AI Receptionist Modular System: Progress Report

## Project Overview
The AI Receptionist Modular System is a comprehensive communication automation platform that leverages advanced NLP and machine learning technologies across multiple channels: voice calls, email, live chat, and WhatsApp. This system aims to unify all communications under a single interface with AI-powered responses and integrations.

## Implementation Progress

### Completed Tasks

#### Database Setup and Schema Definition
- ✅ PostgreSQL database setup complete with 20+ tables
- ✅ Foreign key relationships established with cascade delete semantics
- ✅ Schema includes support for all communication channels
- ✅ Database schema supports user management, configurations, logs, and system monitoring

#### Core Infrastructure
- ✅ DatabaseStorage implementation for persistent storage
- ✅ Environment variable management and secret handling
- ✅ WebSocket server implementation with heartbeat monitoring
- ✅ AI integration with OpenAI and ElevenLabs

#### Voice Call Handling Module
- ✅ Extended call_logs schema with callSid and service columns
- ✅ Centralized call duration tracking in useCallState hook
- ✅ Fixed Twilio API integration issues in routes.ts
- ✅ Implemented proper configuration retrieval for voice services
- ✅ Successfully enabled Twilio test call functionality
- ✅ Implemented error handling for call failures

#### Partial Implementations
- ⚠️ Voice Call Module: SIP integration is configured but not fully tested
- ⚠️ Voice Call Module: OpenPhone integration is configured but not fully tested
- ⚠️ Live Chat: Basic widget implementation complete but some features need refinement

### Pending Tasks

#### Google Calendar Integration
- ❌ OAuth flow for calendar access
- ❌ Popup window for account selection with auto-close
- ❌ Retrieving available time slots based on calendar events
- ❌ Meeting scheduling functionality across channels
- ❌ Secure token storage and encryption

#### Voice Call Handling (Remaining Items)
- ❌ Complete inbound call routing with AI IVR
- ❌ Finalize outbound AI call capabilities
- ❌ Complete speech-to-text transcription for calls
- ❌ Call sentiment analysis implementation

#### Email Management
- ❌ SMTP email configuration
- ❌ SendGrid integration
- ❌ Mailgun integration
- ❌ Email parsing and AI response generation
- ❌ Email to calendar meeting scheduling

#### WhatsApp Integration
- ❌ WhatsApp webhook verification
- ❌ WhatsApp message processing
- ❌ WhatsApp reply handling
- ❌ WhatsApp to calendar event creation

#### System Dashboard
- ❌ Real-time status monitoring
- ❌ Communication channel statistics
- ❌ AI training data management
- ❌ Error logging and reporting

## Next Steps
Based on the implementation document and current progress, the next priority task is:

**Google Calendar Integration**
- This is a critical component that connects to all communication channels
- Requires implementing the OAuth flow for secure access to user calendars
- Needs to manage token refresh and secure storage
- Will enable scheduling capabilities across all channels

Following Google Calendar integration, we'll continue with completing the remaining Voice Call functionality, followed by Email Management, WhatsApp integration, and finally the System Dashboard refinements.

## Technical Considerations
- OAuth tokens must be securely stored and encrypted (no plain text)
- Required Google Calendar scopes: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar and https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events
- WebSocket connections must be stable with proper error handling
- Service integrations should use fallbacks only when primary services are unavailable AND the fallback is active

## Current System Status
The system has a functional voice call testing capability with proper database logging. The database structure is complete and properly connected. The AI integration with OpenAI and ElevenLabs is configured. The next major component (Google Calendar) will add scheduling capabilities that will be utilized by all communication channels.
