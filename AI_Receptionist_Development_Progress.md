# AI Receptionist System – Development Progress & Technical Notes

## Project Overview

The AI Receptionist System is a sophisticated multi-channel communication platform that enables businesses to automate reception-related tasks through artificial intelligence.

## Recent Improvements - Timezone Handling

We recently implemented comprehensive timezone handling across the entire system to address issues with meeting scheduling:

1. **Database Enhancements**:
   - Added timezone column to meeting_logs table
   - Updated schema to properly store and reference timezone information

2. **AI Extraction Improvements**:
   - Enhanced AI extraction prompt to identify and capture timezone information in user messages
   - Added support for recognizing timezone abbreviations (EST, PST, etc.) and converting to IANA format
   - Implemented fallback timezone handling when user doesn't specify a timezone

3. **Calendar Integration Fixes**:
   - Modified Google Calendar API calls to include timezone parameters
   - Updated meeting creation process to properly handle timezone differences
   - Enhanced meeting link generation with timezone-aware details

4. **WhatsApp Integration Updates**:
   - Improved the format of meeting confirmations to include timezone information
   - Enhanced WhatsApp messages with better date/time formatting
   - Added timezone details in meeting confirmation messages

5. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - Updated response formatting to clearly indicate the timezone for scheduled meetings
   - Improved error handling for timezone-related issues

## Technical Notes

### Key Files Modified

1. **server/lib/websocket.ts**
   - Enhanced extraction prompt for timezone data
   - Updated meeting creation logic to include timezone information
   - Improved date formatting with timezone awareness
   - Added timezone to meeting details object

2. **server/routes.ts**
   - Updated WhatsApp meeting confirmation to include timezone information
   - Improved formatting of dates with timezone consideration

3. **server/lib/google-calendar.ts**
   - Modified event creation to include timezone parameters
   - Updated API calls to handle timezone differences properly

4. **shared/schema.ts**
   - Added timezone field to meeting_logs table schema

5. **scripts/add-timezone-field.ts**
   - Created migration script to add timezone column to existing database

### API Changes

- Meeting creation API now requires and handles timezone parameter
- Calendar event creation includes timezone information
- Meeting responses now include formatted times with timezone data

### AI Prompt Enhancements

```
Extract meeting details from the following message. If any information is missing or unclear, indicate that it's unknown.
Return a JSON object with: 
- subject (string, the purpose or title of the meeting)
- date (YYYY-MM-DD format, or "unknown" if not specified)
- time (HH:MM format in 24-hour time, or "unknown" if not specified)
- duration (in minutes, default to 30 if not specified)
- attendees (array of email addresses, or empty array if none specified)
- description (string, additional notes or empty string if none)
- timezone (string, extract any mentioned timezone using IANA timezone format like "America/New_York", "Europe/London", "Asia/Tokyo", etc. When only abbreviations like EST, PST, UTC are mentioned, convert them to proper IANA format. Use "unknown" if not specified.)
```

## Pending Tasks / Issues

While significant progress has been made, some issues still remain to be addressed:

1. **Edge Cases in Timezone Handling**:
   - Need better handling of ambiguous timezone abbreviations
   - Improve detection of implied timezones from location mentions

2. **Email Confirmation Improvements**:
   - Enhance email templates to better display timezone information
   - Add calendar attachments (.ics files) to meeting confirmation emails

3. **WhatsApp Rich Media**:
   - Implement sending calendar attachments via WhatsApp when available
   - Create visually enhanced meeting confirmation templates

4. **Testing & Validation**:
   - Need comprehensive testing across different timezone scenarios
   - Validate edge cases like DST transitions

## Next Steps / Recommendations

To further improve the system, we recommend the following steps:

1. **Enhanced Timezone Detection**:
   - Implement more sophisticated timezone detection from natural language
   - Add location-based timezone inference when timezone isn't explicitly mentioned

2. **Calendar Attachment Support**:
   - Add .ics file generation to email confirmations
   - Implement calendar attachment support for WhatsApp where possible

3. **User Preference System**:
   - Create a system to remember user timezone preferences
   - Implement default timezone settings at the user account level

4. **Testing Framework**:
   - Develop automated testing for timezone edge cases
   - Create a validation system for meeting creation across timezones

5. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Create user guides for timezone handling
   - Update API documentation to reflect timezone requirements

## Conclusion

The AI Receptionist System has made significant progress with the implementation of robust timezone handling. This enhancement addresses the critical issue where meetings scheduled through the AI agent weren't showing up properly due to timezone mismatches. The system now properly extracts, stores, and displays timezone information across all communication channels, ensuring consistent and reliable meeting scheduling functionality.
